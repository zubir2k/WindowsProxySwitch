Turn ON/OFF Proxy using Windows batch file.
If you find it frustrating to enable/disable proxy everytime when switching connection from Office to Home,
Run this batch file to switch on/off proxy automatically. Tested on Windows 7 to Windows 10.

## Instruction:
Just copy the batch file and place it somewhere easier to run (e.g. your Desktop).
For first run, it will try and syncronize with current proxy settings. So be sure to run it few times first.

## Indicator:
The filename will change depending on the current proxy settings 
1) Proxy ON.bat - proxy is ON
2) Proxy OFF.bat - proxy is OFF

## Troubleshoot:
Inside the batch file, there are debug tag which I have comment out. 
Remove the `REM` to enable debugging.
